Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. Using techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project aims to extract sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) from social media posts (such as Twitter data) and visualize these sentiments to uncover trends and patterns.

The analysis helps in gaining insights into how the public feels about certain topics or brands, enabling organizations and individuals to make informed decisions.
Objective

    Extract and preprocess social media data (e.g., from Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit).
    Perform sentiment analysis using NLP techniques to classify the sentiment of each post as positive, negative, or neutral.
    Visualize sentiment patterns over time and by various categories (e.g., hashtags, user demographics, etc.).
    Analyze the sentiment distribution for specific topics or brands to understand public opinion.

Dataset Overview

This project uses a dataset of social media posts, which may include:

    Text: The content of the post (e.g., tweet or comment).
    Timestamp: When the post was made.
    User Info: User demographics like location, followers count, and age (if available).
    Topic/Brand: The topic or brand being discussed in the post.
    Hashtags: The hashtags used in the post.
    Likes, Retweets, Shares: Engagement metrics to understand the reach of the post.
    Example Data (Twitter):
Text	Timestamp	User	Sentiment	Hashtags
"Love the new iPhone, it's amazing!"	2025-02-20 12:30:00	@user123	Positive	#iPhone, #Apple
"iPhone prices are getting crazy..."	2025-02-21 08:45:00	@user456	Negative	#iPhone, #Apple
"Samsung's camera is top-notch!"	2025-02-21 14:00:00	@user789	Positive	#Samsung, #Tech
"Not a fan of the new Android update"	2025-02-22 18:30:00	@user101	Negative	#Android, #Update
Steps in This Project
1. Data Collection

    Use social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Reddit API, etc.) to gather posts related to specific topics or brands.
       Collect relevant metadata such as timestamp, user information, hashtags, and engagement metrics.
    Example: Collect 1000 tweets containing specific hashtags like #iPhone, #Samsung, or #Android.

2. Data Preprocessing

    Text cleaning: Remove stop words, URLs, punctuation, and special characters.
    Tokenization: Break text into words or phrases.
    Lemmatization/Stemming: Convert words to their root form.
    Removing duplicates: Ensure the data is clean and free of redundant posts.

3. Sentiment Analysis

    Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or fine-tuned BERT models) to classify the sentiment of each post.
        Positive: The post expresses a favorable opinion.
        Negative: The post expresses an unfavorable opinion.
           Neutral: The post expresses no strong sentiment or is balanced.
    Optionally, fine-tune models using labeled social media data to improve accuracy.

4. Visualization and Analysis

    Sentiment Distribution: Visualize the distribution of sentiments across different topics or brands (e.g., pie charts or bar plots).
    Time-Based Trends: Plot sentiment trends over time to see how opinions evolve (e.g., line plots showing sentiment over days or weeks).
    Hashtag Analysis: Visualize the most common hashtags and how they relate to sentiment (e.g., word clouds or bar charts).
    Geographical Sentiment: If location data is available, analyze sentiment by geographic region using maps or scatter plots.
    Engagement Metrics: Analyze how sentiment correlates with engagement metrics (likes, retweets, etc.).
   5. Insights and Reporting

    Topic Analysis: Identify which topics are generating the most positive or negative sentiment.
    Brand Sentiment: Understand public opinion about specific brands (e.g., Apple vs. Samsung).
    Impact of External Events: Analyze how events (e.g., product launches, controversies) affect sentiment trends.
    Customer Feedback: Use sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with products or services.

Libraries Used

    Tweepy (for accessing Twitter API)
    Pandas (for data manipulation)
    Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
    TextBlob and VADER (for sentiment analysis)
    WordCloud (for hashtag and word cloud generation)
    GeoPandas (for geographical sentiment analysis, if location data is available)

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
cd social-media-sentiment-analysis

2. Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up API credentials:

    For Twitter, create a developer account and generate API keys at Twitter Developer.
    Add your API credentials to the configuration file (e.g., config.py).

4. Run the data collection script:

python collect_data.py

This script will pull relevant social media posts from the configured API (e.g., Twitter) and save them into a CSV or JSON file.
5. Run sentiment analysis and visualization:

python analyze_sentiment.py

This script will perform sentiment analysis on the collected data and generate visualizations such as sentiment distributions, trends over time, and hashtag analysis.
Example Visualizations

    Sentiment Distribution by Brand: A pie chart showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments for specific brands (e.g., iPhone, Samsung).
    Sentiment Trend Over Time: A line graph showing how sentiment changes over time (e.g., during a product launch or marketing campaign).
    Word Cloud: A word cloud visualizing the most common words used in posts, with sentiment-specific clouds (positive vs. negative).
    Geographical Sentiment Analysis: A map showing sentiment distribution by country or region (if location data is available).

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis on social media data can provide valuable insights into public opinion about topics or brands. By leveraging NLP techniques and social media APIs, we can analyze and visualize trends, helping brands, marketers, and researchers understand customer attitudes and improve decision-making processes.
